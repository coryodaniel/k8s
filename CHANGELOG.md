## [2.0.0] - 2023-01-27

This version comes with some breaking changes. Please refer to the
[migrations guide](./guides/migrations.md) for help on how to migrate your
projects to this version.

### Added

- `K8s.Selector.label_not/N`, `K8s.Selector.field/N` and `K8s.Selector.field_not/N` - Support for field selectors ([#117](https://github.com/coryodaniel/k8s/pull/117))
- `K8s.Client.Provider.stream/5` callback was added to the behaviour
- `K8s.Client.Runner.Base.stream/3`
- `K8s.Client.Provider.stream_to/6` callback was added to the behaviour
- `K8s.Client.Runner.Base.stream_to/4`
- `K8s.Client.MintHTTPProvider` - The mint client implementation
- `K8s.Client.HTTPTestHelper` - to be used in tests (resides in `lib/` so it can be used by dependents)
- Open `:connect` operations (connections) now accept messages to be sent to pods if using `K8s.Client.stream_to/N`
- `K8s.Client.put_conn/2` to add pielining support to the Client API

### Changed

- `K8s.Client.Provider` behaviour was adapted to the new internal architecture
- `K8s.Client.watch/N` now returns a `:watch` or `:watch_all_namespaces` operation to be passed to `K8s.Client.stream/N`
- `Websockex` was replaced by [`Mint.WebSocket`](https://hexdocs.pm/mint_web_socket/Mint.WebSocket.html)

### Removed

- `K8s.Client.HTTPProvider` was removed in favor of `K8s.Client.MintHTTPProvider`

- `K8s.Client.DynamicWebSocketProvider` was removed in favor of `K8s.Client.DynamcHTTPProvider.websocket*` functions.

- Errors are encapsulated in `K8s.Client.HTTPError`
- `headers/1` callback was removed from `K8s.Client.Provider` behaviour.
